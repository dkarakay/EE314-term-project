You are going to implement your project on the FPGA boards that you will borrow from us. In the project, you will manage data traffic between two nodes, where four different message types are transmitted as shown in Figure 1. The input of the system will be a 4-bit sequence (call it as a packet) which is generated by the FPGA buttons. You may use one button for “0” and one for “1”. By pressing the buttons, you will generate a bit sequence. In addition, before creating each bit sequence, you should press a start button to indicate that a packet is to be transmitted. The first two bits of the packet (“B0B1”) are the header bits, and based on the header bits, you should fill the corresponding buffer with the remaining value in decimal form. As can be seen in Figure 1, there are four buffers, which are represented with different colors. The buffer depth is 6 so you can store at most 6 packets at each buffer. If a new packet arrives at a buffer, which is full, then the oldest data is deleted (packet dropping), and the newcomer is added to the queue after shifting the remaining data by one register. You may use the array structure of Verilog HDL to implement buffers. For example, if the bit-sequence “0110” is sent after pressing the start button, your code should make the next white box of “Buffer 2” blue and print “2” inside that box. The second part of the project is to read the data from suitable buffers. For this purpose, you should implement an algorithm that decides the buffer from which data is read, according to the given criteria. For a given buffer, the oldest data is read first, in a first-in-first-out manner.
